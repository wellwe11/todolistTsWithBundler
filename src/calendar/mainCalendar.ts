// step 1
// create a page selector
// each page will be a month, which is based on a year
// when a page is selected, a new date for that month is created
// whenever the page changes, data is re-created, and a new calendar month is made

// step 2
// for each day in current month, a div container is created
// each div container should have a day associated to it
// each div container should have an id of day, month and year

// step 3
// each time a month is created, scan local storage for matching dates
// each time a matching date is found, place it correctly on matching day

// step 4
// when user clicks on date, expand length of day div.
// the div should contain a time-list
// Events should be spread over the date to find matching time, and pin it to them
